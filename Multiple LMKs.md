Multiple LMKs

It is possible to install more than one LMK on a single HSM. The exact number and type of LMKs that can be installed are controlled via the HSM's license file.

Depending on the license you can operate multiple LMKs. As mentioned earlier there are two LMK types: Key Block and Variant.

Licenses:
- **Default** – If no specific multi-LMK license is present, two LMKs can be used (one Key Block and one Variant).
- **HSM9-LIC012 LMK x2** – Two LMKs can be installed simultaneously; any combination of Variant and Key Block LMKs (optional license).
- **HSM9-LIC013 LMK x5** – Up to five LMKs can be installed simultaneously; any combination of Variant and Key Block LMKs (optional license).
- **HSM9-LIC021 LMK x10** – Up to ten LMKs can be installed simultaneously; Variant and Key Block combinations allowed.
- **HSM9-LIC022 LMK x20** – Up to twenty LMKs can be installed simultaneously; Variant and Key Block combinations allowed.
