View / Reset Utilization Data

Function: Displays utilization data via the console. You can print or reset this data.

Authorization: None required.

Note: Utilization statistics are reset whenever new software is loaded onto the HSM. For example, a load range defined as "%10-20" means "exactly 10% up to just under 20%". Statistics are provided regardless of which host interface received the commands.

Inputs: Optionally reset the data and print the accumulated data from the HSM.
